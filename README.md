# Testing Vite + React route-based code splitting demo

This app is initialized with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):

```sh
 pnpm create vite vite-react-code-splitting-demo --template react-ts
```

## Time costs

|   | without route-based code splitting   | with route-based code splitting  |
|---|---|---|
| dev page load time(s)  | 14  | 3  |
| HMR time(s)  | <1  | <1  |
| yarn build time(s) | 35  | 170  |
| serve dist page load time(s)  | 164  | 132  |
| serve dist initial transfer(KB)  | 68  | 76  |
| serve dist initial transfer(KB)  | 890  | 316  |

* There is more initial transfer data with code splitting than without code splitting. ü§£ Maybe because our page component contains too little code.

## TODO

- On my Mac, I am generating 1000 page components with this code in [gen_pages.sh](gen_pages.sh) file. How can I generate 1000 page component quicker? Please fire an issue or send a PR. Thanks in advance.‚ù§Ô∏è

    ```sh
    cp SamplePage.tsx temp
    gsed -i "s/PageName/Page$i/" temp
    cp temp "src/pages/Page$i.tsx"
    ```
